        <h2><u>Descriptions</u></h2>        
        <div><u>Simple Cry:</u> For $20, we will send one of our agents to your venue to simply cry. 
            Though the simple cry won't attract much attention, it will be noticed 
            by the other attendants of the event.</div>
        <br>        
        <div><u>Loud Cry:</u> For $50, we will send one of our agents to very 
            noticeably cry at the venue. Tears, snot, stutters, everything about 
            a solid good cry will be included in this package. </div> 
        <br>
        <div><u>Wailing and Ground Roll:</u> Is a loud cry not enough for you? 
            No worries, for $75 you will not only receive the benefits of a loud 
            cry, you will also receive the benefits of ground stomping, kneeling 
            and cries, and most importantly, ground rolling. </div>
        <br>
        <div><u>Threatening to Jump With the Casket:</u> We understand, 
            superficial acts like crying may not be convincing enough for the 
            attendants of your funeral. No worries, for a low, low, $100, one of
            our agents will perform, not just everything discussed thus far, but
            actually threaten to jump in the hole with the casket!</div>
        <br>
        <div><u>Actually Jumping in the Casket:</u> Is threatening to jump into 
            the casket not enough for you? Well, what if our agents actually 
            jump into the casket? For $150, that can become true!</div>
        <br>
        <div><u>Threatening to Assault People at the Venue:</u> So maybe jumping
            into the casket is not your type of thing, we understand. So, what 
            if one of agents actually threatens to, as the youngsters call it 
            nowadays, "throw some hands?" well, for $200, that can be true!
        </div>
        <br>
        <div><u>Actually Assaulting People at the Venue:</u> If you really want 
            to see some action, then for $300, we will send a handful of our 
            agents to perform a choreographed fight sequence that will truly 
            amaze the attendants and prompt them to wonder the true past of 
            the deceased.</div>
