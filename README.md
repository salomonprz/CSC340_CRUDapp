# CSC340_CRUDapp
This repo houses a CRUD application that uses the XAMPP database named "csc340-cruddemo" to store information to create a Food list, using the product list we saw in class as a foundation.

Once cleaned, built, and properly running, type in "http://localhost:8080/product/all" to access the Food List.
